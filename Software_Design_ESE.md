## Previous Year Questions

Q1. a. **Write a code to check if matrix has inverse or not. Draw control flow graph (CFG) for the same. <br>Find out total number of linearly independent path in CFG. <br>Give McCabe's metric or Number of test cases for the CFG.**

Ans.

<hr>

Q1. b. **Why it is said to "Keep level of Abstraction as high as possible"? <br>How does it help in software design**

Ans.

<hr>

Q1. c. **Which according to you is better architecture? Data flow architecture or data centered architecture?**

Ans. 

<hr>

Q1. d. **What are different types of Coupling? List and explain each of the type**

Ans.

<hr>

Q2. a. **Why do you think software development should focus on the needs of users?**

Ans.
 Software development should focus on the needs of the users for the following reasons : $R^3$
* To *reduce training and support* costs ( i.e, make it so that users naturally understand how to use the software ).
* To *reduce time to learn* the system..
* To *reduce costs by developing only the required features*.
* To *create a UI accurate to what the user wants*.
* Since UI is the entire application for users, making sure it is good and according to what the user wants is very important.

This is mainly to answer these following questions : 
- *What is it that they need to do?*
- *Are they comfortable with the UI?*
- *Do they ‘see’ what they feel they need to see?*

<hr>

Q2. b. **What characteristics of users must be focused on in the software development process?**

Ans.
#### Characteristics are as follows : 
- **Goals for using the system**
	- What is the work the users need to get done?
- **Potential patterns of use**
	- 24-7? EOM/EOD/EOY? On-line; batch? Peak load
times? Down times? MTTR?
- **Demographics**
	- Cultures; religions; sensitivities
- **Knowledge of the application domain**
	- Finance and accounting? Manufacturing? Process control? Real time? Student environment?
- **Physical ability**
	- ADA? Other physical limitations

<hr>

Q2. c. **Differentiate between usability and utility with respect to software design.**

Ans.
### Usability

* Does the system allow the user to learn and to use raw capabilities easily?

The Key aspects of usability are : 
- **Learnability:** How easy is it for users to learn how to use the system?
- **Efficiency:** Once users have learned the system, how quickly can they perform tasks?
- **Memorability:** After a period of not using the system, how easily can users re-establish proficiency?
- **Error Prevention and Recovery:** How well does the system prevent errors, and if errors occur, how easily can users recover?
- **User Satisfaction:** How satisfied are users with their overall experience?

*Example:* An e-commerce website with a clear and intuitive navigation menu, simple checkout process, and helpful error messages has good usability.

### Utility

* Does the system provide the raw capabilities to allow the user to achieve their goal

The key aspects of utility are :
- **Relevance:** How well does the system address the user's specific requirements or objectives?
- **Functionality:** Does the system provide the necessary features and tools to accomplish tasks?
- **Value:** How much value does the user perceive in using the system?
- **Fit for Purpose:** Is the system designed to serve its intended purpose effectively?
   
*Example:* A project management software that includes features such as task tracking, team collaboration, and reporting provides utility for users managing complex projects.

Q2. d. **What aspects can usability be divided into? Explain with examples.**

Q3. a. **How do various stakeholders in the software industry evaluate user interfaces?**

Ans.

<hr>

Q3. b. **Explain the top-down design approach in software architecture design.**

Ans.
#### Top-down 
* First design the high level structures of the system
* Then work your way down to the low level constructs
* Finally arrive at the detailed decisions such as : 
	* Format of data items
	* Individual algorithms

Start with the software architecture and the type of database to be used

<hr>

Q3. c. **List and explain principles leading to good design.**

Ans.

<hr>

Q3. d. **Explain communication cohesion with reference to architectural design.**

Ans.

<hr>

Q4. a. **What are the different architectural styles? Which one would you choose for the software project "Digitization of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Central Library of VJTI"?**

Ans.

<hr>

Q4. b. **Consider that software is to be built for the automatic recording of online meeting attendance. Assume suitable data and create a data model (ER-based).**

Ans.

<hr>

Q4. c. **List and explain Pattern Description Parameters with reference to software design patterns**

Ans.

<hr>

Q4. d. **List the various design patterns in Gangs of Four design pattern explain any one**

Ans. 

<hr>

Q5. **Write code and draw class diagram to explain observer pattern (consider suitable example)**

Ans.

<hr>
